# ðŸ“Š Sales Classification on Imbalanced Data

A machine learning exploration into classifying sales performance using real-world imbalanced dataâ€”combining structured modeling, reflective evaluation, and philosophical depth.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that predict sales performance (High vs Low volume) while addressing challenges of class imbalance, feature scaling, and model interpretability.

---

## ðŸ§  Models & Techniques

This project compares four distinct classification approaches:

- âœ… **Random Forest Classifier** with `class_weight='balanced'`
- âœ… **Logistic Regression**: with and without SMOTE oversampling
- âœ… **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with feature scaling
- âœ… âœ¨ Evaluation tools: Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, Accuracy

Preprocessing highlights:
- ðŸ“ˆ Feature Scaling via `StandardScaler`
- ðŸ§ª SMOTE for synthetic oversampling
